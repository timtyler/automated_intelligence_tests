Note: at the time of writing question quality (from Gemini) seems to be very poor.

Output some multiple choice questions to act as a test of capability.

 * Generate 10 test questions containing images.
 * The questions should be numbered from 1 to 10.
 * Two different questions should not have the same number.
 * The number of the question should precede the question's image.
 * Output one blank line before every question. Do not output any other blank lines.
 * The list of questions should contain no duplicated questions.

This is a list of properties of the test questions:

 * The theme of the questions is: pattern recognition.
 * Questions should be primartily in the form of generated images.
 * All questions should contain an image.
 * A text question referring to the image should also be included.
 * Text questions should be underneath their associated image.
 * Text questions should end with a question mark.
 * Text questions should not be split over more than one line.
 * Questions should be very challenging: we do not want questions that are easy to answer.
 * If factual knowledge is needed to answer the question, supply that knowledge in the text question.
 * As far as reasonably possible, questions should have an umambiguous correct answer.
 * Between 1 and 4 plausible-sounding but incorrect alternative answers to the questions should be generated.
 * The correct answer and the alternative answers should be assigned alphabetic symbols.
 * The correct answer and the alternative answers should be randomly sorted.
 * The first alphabetic symbol should be "A". Do not skip over any letters.
 * The alphabetic symbols should be assigned to the answers in alphabetic order.
 * Each question has the alphabetic symbol of the correct answer on its own line.
 * Correct question answers should be prefixed by "The correct answer is: ".
 * To help with review of the question, a rationale for the correct answer should be given on its own line.
 * Question rationales should be underneath the question, prefixed by "Rationale: ".
