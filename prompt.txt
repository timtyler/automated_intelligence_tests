 * The correct answer and the alternative answers should be assigned alphabetic symbols.
 * The correct answer and the alternative answers should be randomly sorted.
 * The first alphabetic symbol should be "A". Do not skip over any letters.
 * The alphabetic symbols should be assigned to the answers in alphabetic order.
 * Each question has the alphabetic symbol of the correct answer on its own line.
 * Correct question answers should be prefixed by "The correct answer is: ".
 * To help with review of the question, a rationale for the correct answer should be given on its own line.
