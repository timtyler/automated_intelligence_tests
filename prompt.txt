Output some multiple choice questions to act as an intelligence test.

 * Generate 10 test questions. Questions should be numbered from 1 to 10.
 * The list of test questions should contain no duplicated questions.
 * Output one blank line before every question. Do not output any other blank lines.

The properties of the test questions are those in the following list:

 * Questions should be numbered. The number should precede the question. 
 * Questions should end with a question mark.
 * As far as reasonably possible, questions should have an umambiguous correct answer.
 * Questions should test for intelligence. General knowledge questions are undesirable.
 * If factual knowledge is needed to answer the question, supply that knowledge in the question.
 * Questions should be reasonably short. No rambling on.
 * Questions should be challenging. We do not want a test that everyone can pass.
 * No questions about spelling.
 * No questions about numbers bigger than 10.
 * Between 3 and 5 plausible-sounding but incorrect alternative answers to the questions should be generated.
 * The correct answer and the alternative answers should be assigned alphabetic symbols.
 * The correct answer and the alternative answers should be randomly sorted.
 * The alphabetic symbols should be in the range from "A" to "F".
 * The alphabetic symbols should be assigned to the answers in alphabetic order.
 * Each question has the alphabetic symbol of the correct answer on its own line, prefixed by "The correct answer is: ".
 * To help with review of the question, a rationale for the correct answer should be given on its own line at underneath the question, prefixed by "Rationale: "
